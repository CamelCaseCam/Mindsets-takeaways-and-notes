* Don't be tied to your plans. Things might change, and if a better opportunity presents itself, you need to be able to pivot
* Genius isn't real. Some people have natural advantages, but you need to work hard to get anywhere

You should have a general picture of what you want to put your effort into (values, what kind of life you want to have), and work from both directions to decide what to do. 
* Figure out which areas have more potential and go there
	* Work on hard problems => pretty much the mission of TKS
* Treat high school like a day job. You still need to put effort into it, but it shouldn't define you
* College admissions officers can't tell how smart you are, so you shouldn't be **trying** to impress them

His suggestions:
* Pick a project that will take you less than a month to finish. Once you finish it (or it fails), keep trying over and over again
* Don't worry about seeming "cool". Just do something that feels fun to you, and see where things go.
