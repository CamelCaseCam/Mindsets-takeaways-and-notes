# What is poverty?
Poverty is when you don't have the resources you need to provide for yourself and/or your family. The thing is, whether you're "living in poverty" depends a lot on the definition of poverty where you live. For example, the international poverty line is set at $1.90 per day, while the US poverty line is $35.29 per day. To be fair, these different definitons of poverty do make sense. The cost of living will be different in different places, so these different places should have different poverty lines. 

Despite that, there's a lot of criticism about the $1.90 poverty line. Anyone living on less than $5 per day will be unable to properly meet their needs. Also, using a concrete cutoff erases the distinction between different levels of poverty. Someone living on a couple of cents per day is in a much worse position than someone living on a couple of dollars per day. At the end of the day, poverty is a really complicated issue, and this problem with definitions is a reflection of that. 

# Effects of poverty
## Health
### Malnutrition
* Weakens immune system
* Weakens body & prevents repair
* Stunts development (physiological and mental) in children

### Other causes
* More likely to have a disability (may be a cause of poverty)
* Illness also increases poverty - viciouss cycle
* Lack of access to healthcare also harms health
* Higher chance at exposure to polutants and other harmful chemicals

## Education
* Children living in poverty are less likely to finish high school. If that's even an option
	* More illness increases time away from school
	* Unsafe conditions make going to school harder/more risky

## Shelter and location
* Living in poverty increases the risk of homelessness. This has effects on health and education and compounds the detrimental effects of poverty
* There's a theory that concentrations of poverty make poverty worse. The theory goes that if a bunch of people of different income levels live together, the people living in poverty will have a better network and access to better schools/healthcare services/resources and will benefit from it.


Something important to mention is that poverty is closely tied with gender inequality. In many places with a lot of gender inequality, the richest portion of the popluation is much more equal than the poorest portion. You may be wondering if this means that either poverty or gender inequality is caused by the other issue. I'd argue that they're seperate issues, but one can be helped by targeting the other. 


# Root causes
Wow. That was a lot. I don't know about you, but I'm feeling pretty hopeless right now. This is such a big, messy issue, but in my experience, those issues tend to have one or two root causes that are being manifested in a bunch of ways. Here's what I found for the 1<sup>st</sup> order causes of poverty:

1. Not enough access to food and/or water
2. Not enough access to quality healthcare
3. Unequal distribution of resources
4. Discrimination/inequality
5. Lack of education
6. Ecological damage (climate change, soil destruction, overfishing/overhunting etc)
7. Problems with governance/corruption
8. Conflict
9. Individual debt
10. Regional/national debt
11. Not enough access to jobs (people aren't lazy, they'd prefer to work when the alternative is starving)
12. Concentration of land and resources in the hands of the few

Okay, now I'm going to try to find root causes here. Everything after this is my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. 

I'm going to start by simplifying this list a little bit to make it easier to tackle. 

First things first, I'm going to remove discrimination/inequality from the list. It's definitely a big factor, but it's a bit of a seperate issue from poverty. It's something that would be improved by reducing poverty, but I don't think they have the same root causes. Instead, I'd classify both poverty and discrimination as contributing factors for each other. 

Next, I'm going to combine concentration of land and unequal distribution of resources. Here's what that looks like:

1. Not enough access to food and/or water
2. Not enough access to quality healthcare
3. Unequal distribution of resources (including land)
4. Lack of education
5. Ecological damage (climate change, soil destruction, overfishing/overhunting etc)
6. Problems with governance/corruption
7. Conflict
8. Individual debt
9. Regional/national debt
10. Not enough access to jobs (people aren't lazy, they'd prefer to work when the alternative is starving)

I'm going to make the assumption that access to food, water, and quality healthcare would all be improved by distributing resources, along with individual debt. Because of that, I'm going to combine these into the 2<sup>nd</sup> order cause of "distribution of resources". You can see that, while this is an oversimplification, it does give us a different perspective on the root causes of poverty. 

1. Distribution of resources
2. Lack of education
3. Ecological damage (climate change, soil destruction, overfishing/overhunting etc)
4. Problems with governance/corruption
5. Conflict
6. Regional/national debt
7. Not enough access to jobs (people aren't lazy, they'd prefer to work when the alternative is starving)

All of these causes are really, really messy causes. They have a bunch of contributing factors, and we can't really combine any of them (yet). These factors will probably have different causes in different places, too. However, I am going to try to combine them into buckets to give an idea of where we can focus on. 

## Bucket 1: Local issues
Bucket 1 covers issues with the place where you live. This includes:
* Corruption
* Conflict
* National debt
* Access to jobs due to a lack of jobs in the economy
* Access to basic necessities

## Bucket 2: Global issues
This bucket covers issues that, while they might be more severe in one area, affect everyone. This includes
* Ecological damage
* Distribution of resources
* Discrimination

The key difference between buckets 1 and 2 is that the issues in bucket 1 have sharp boundaries, while something in bucket 2 is more fuzzy. There might be one area that's super ecologically damaged, but there won't be a sharp line between fine and not fine. Instead, there will be degrees of damage. 

Another example of one of these issues is sexism (part of discrimination). While sexism is more prevelant in certain areas, there isn't one defined area where sexism happens. Instead, there are degrees of sexism present everywhere. Feel free to replace sexism with your chosen "-ism", the same will be true for that issue. 

## Bucket 3: Personal issues
Bucket 3 contains all the issues that are specific to one individual. This includes things like lack of education and disability, but most of these issues can be broken down into sub-issues that are tied to issues in other buckets. This includes:
* Lack of education
	* Access to jobs due to a lack of education (there are jobs, just not for you)
* Disability
* Addiction

All of these issues in bucket 3 can and should be broken down further. For example, who isn't getting educated? Are there too few schools, or are people lacking education for some other reason? Is this really being caused by an issue in another bucket? The answers to these questions will be different in different places. 

You'll notice that I didn't include "bad luck" anywhere in this section. The thing is, bad luck is never the root cause of poverty. Bad luck may have been the thing that finally pushed someone over the edge, but we should be asking why they were that close to the edge to begin with. Bad luck may have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but it wasn't the real cause.
